stress-predictor
================

The goal of the code in this repo is to create a prediction of user stress using data from the autosense sensor suite.

# Data #
If you cloned this repo, you should find an empty /data folder; most scripts assume that data is stored here, but in order to preserve subject confidentiality no data is included in the repo. The /data folder is included in the .gitignore folder to prevent accidental commits of data. In the future fake data may be added for testing, but until then you will need to put your data there and tell scripts how to find it manually.
